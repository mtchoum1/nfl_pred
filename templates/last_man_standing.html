    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Progression</strong>: If your chosen team wins, you advance to the next week with your perfect record intact.</li>
        <li><strong>Imperfect Record</strong>: If your chosen team loses or the game ends in a tie, your record becomes "imperfect." You are not eliminated and can continue to make picks each week.</li>
        <li><strong>No Repeats</strong>: You cannot select the same team more than once during the season.</li>
        <li><strong>Divisional Lockout</strong>: Once you pick from a division, it is locked until you have picked a team from all 8 divisions. After that, the cycle resets.</li>
        <li><strong>Sequential Picks</strong>: You must make your picks in order. You cannot pick for a future week until you have made a pick for the current one.</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly Lockout</strong>: Picks for a given week become locked when the first game of that week begins. You cannot make or change a pick after this time.</li>
        <li><strong>No Submission</strong>: If you forget to make a pick for a week, it counts as a loss, and your record will become imperfect.</li>
        <li><strong>Winner</strong>: The player with the most total wins at the end of the season is the winner. The current streak is used as a tie-breaker.</li>
